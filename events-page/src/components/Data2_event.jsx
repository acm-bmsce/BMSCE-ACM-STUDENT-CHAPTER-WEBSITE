        fullDescription: 'The workshop, led by Mr. Sachin Lodha, Chief Scientist at TCS Research, was a fun and engaging session that introduced the concept of algorithms in a very relatable way. It started with a creative comparison asking, “Are you a good cook?” Just like a recipe gives step-by-step instructions to make a dish, an algorithm gives step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. A good recipe, or algorithm, not only gives the correct result but does so quickly and with less effort. This idea was made even more memorable with a reference to Amitabh Bachchan making an omelet in the movie Coolie. Participants were then introduced to what an algorithm actually is: a systematic process that solves a problem in a limited number of steps. To make the learning interactive, two classic problem scenarios were discussed. In the Hamlet’s Ski Rental Problem, Hamlet has to decide whether to rent or buy skis each day, without knowing how long he will continue skiing. This introduced the idea of online algorithms and decision-making under uncertainty. In the Treasure Hunt Problem, a blindfolded person stands at the origin while a treasure is hidden somewhere on the X-axis. The challenge is to find a strategy that helps the person locate the treasure with the least amount of walking. This introduced the doubling strategy and important concepts like competitive ratio and the Beeza-Yates theorem. The session used storytelling and real-life examples to explain technical concepts, making the learning enjoyable and memorable for everyone who attended'
,        outcomes: "The workshop helped participants gain a clear understanding of what algorithms are and how they can be used to solve real-life problems. Through engaging examples like Hamlet’s ski rental dilemma and the treasure hunt scenario, they learned how to make smart decisions even when the future is uncertain. The session introduced useful strategies such as the Doubling Strategy and explained key ideas like online algorithms, competitive ratio, and cost optimization in a simple and relatable way. It also encouraged logical thinking and step-by-step problem-solving. Overall, the workshop sparked curiosity and interest in algorithm design and competitive programming, making the learning process both fun and meaningful.",

The event had four unique rounds, each testing different skills like teamwork, creativity, and quick thinking. The first round, Bomb Diffusion, took place in Roblox, where one teammate gave instructions while the other worked to diffuse a virtual bomb. This round was all about communication and trust. In the second round, Fliptionary, one teammate drew in the air using a flipped screen, while the other had to guess the word—leading to lots of laughs and surprises. The third round, Movie Charades, had one teammate give a prompt to Google Gemini AI, and the other guessed the movie based on the AI-generated image. The final round, Draw & Dare, used UNO cards to assign fun tasks. Each team had three chances to draw a card and complete a dare based on its color, earning points as they went. Duos Dash 3.0 brought together tech, creativity, and teamwork in a fun and memorable way. It truly matched the energy and excitement of UTSAV 2025. "

Nerf Nexus was a dart game where players could take risks using harder challenges to possibly double their points. Picture It tested memory by showing items briefly, then asking players to recall details. The points earned in this round were very important for moving ahead and came in handy later to unlock clues or mess with other teams.\n\n' +
    'Round 2 was "The Barter of Relics," a card trading game with a twist. Players got cool-looking fictional cards based on Marvel and sci-fi themes, but they didn’t know how valuable each card really was. They had to trade using their gut, charm, and strategy. At the end, the hidden values of the cards were revealed, which changed everyone’s scores and decided who stayed in the game.\n\n' +
    'Round 3, "The Final Convergence," brought it all together with a riddle-solving race. Teams faced a series of connected riddles based on five deep themes. Solving each riddle required spending their hard-earned points. They could also use special power-ups to delay or confuse their rivals. The event ended with a thrilling sprint to solve the final mystery first.'

        fullDescription:
        "Mr. Sikhar Patranabis shared insights on the journey of cryptography from theoretical foundations to practical implementations, highlighting challenges in bridging provable security with real-world deployment. The talk explored the fascinating field of cryptography as pursued by IBM Research India, where around 200 researchers were engaged in pioneering work on threat management, cloud infrastructure, secure data and AI handling, as well as decentralized trust. The central theme was Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)—a groundbreaking cryptographic protocol that allowed one party (the prover) to convince another (the verifier) that a certain statement was true, without disclosing any additional information beyond the truth of the statement itself. ZKPs were built on four core principles: completeness (if the statement was true, an honest verifier would be convinced), soundness (a dishonest provider could not convince the verifier of a false statement), zero knowledge (no knowledge beyond the assertion was revealed), and succinctness (the proofs were short and efficiently verifiable). These principles were brought to life through intuitive examples, such as the color blindness test involving red and green balls and the Ali Baba cave scenario, both of which demonstrated how knowledge could be proven without exposure. The talk further delved into ZKPs of knowledge, such as demonstrating possession of a secret key (e.g., discrete logarithm problems) without revealing it, and highlighted the importance of arithmetic circuits for representing complex relations in general-purpose ZKP systems. These circuits formed the foundation of modern ZKP protocols, including SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), which offered compact proof sizes and low verification costs. The talk also connected these cryptographic advances to real-world applications, particularly in blockchain technology, where zk-rollups were used to improve scalability. By offloading computation and enabling succinct verification of state updates, zk-rollups helped reduce gas fees, increase transaction throughput, and maintain the integrity of blockchain systems. Overall, the talk emphasized how cryptographic innovation was not only theoretically rich but also practically vital for the future of secure computing and scalable decentralized systems."

    "This iTeach initiative helped foster computational thinking at various levels, from basic pattern recognition to more advanced algorithmic concepts, providing both volunteers and students a chance to develop essential problem-solving skills."
,        outcomes: "The CS Pathshala program by the ACM India Council introduced computational thinking to young learners through engaging activities. Collaborating with the iTeach initiative by BMSCE Rotaract Club, the event combined technical education with personal growth. Volunteers honed skills like communication and teamwork while fostering critical thinking and problem-solving among students.",
